        go to george washington carver high school, that is where the start of my true journey will begin. I strive to be
        in the computer science field for my career, mainly the programming side. Not only am I a computer nerd i’m also
        very athletic something you would never think go together right. Sports has always been with me even as a little
        kid. With that you can see I am a very committed person. If I like something a lot I will stick with it till the
        very end.
